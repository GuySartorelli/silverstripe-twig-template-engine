# Silverstripe Twig Template Engine

An experimental POC twig templating engine for Silverstripe CMS

The code in this repository requires breaking changes in framework to work correctly. It is an experiment primarily intended for my own learning - but if you want to play around with it as well you'll need to use the `experimental-view-refactor` branch in [my fork of silverstripe/framework](https://github.com/GuySartorelli/silverstripe-framework/tree/experimental-view-refactor).
